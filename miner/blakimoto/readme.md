### Blakimoto

Blakimoto is the PoW mining algorithm. It is based on Ethash but without the memory hard 
mining capabilities. Blakimoto is intended to be a pure PoW implementation using
Blake2b-256 as the hashing function. Current difficulty algorithm is the same as 
Ethash Frontier difficulty formula.
